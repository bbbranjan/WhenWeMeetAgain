# WhenWeMeetAgain
Created during NUS Hack&Roll 2015.

WhenWeMeetAgain is a simple modified reminder application that uses proximity of two users as opposed to time based or location based reminders.

WhenWeMeetAgain allows one to set a reminder on an android phone with the bluetooth address of another phone and the content of the reminder. The next time these two phones come within the bluetooth range of one another, the application will send a notification to the user. 

## Running the Application:
